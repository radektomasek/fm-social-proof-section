# Social proof section

This repository contains an implementation of one of the Frontend Mentor Challenges - [Social proof section](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/social-proof-section-6e0qTv_bA) using HTML/CSS.

## Overview

### The Challenge

[This challenge](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/social-proof-section-6e0qTv_bA) was the eleventh one I picked from the [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io).

The process of creating the solution was quite straighforward. When picking up the challenge, I liked most of the cards/rating components that hadn't been aligned in straight lines. I imagined the solution relatively quickly and was glad it worked well when implemented.

But as usual, let's breakup the solution in the next few sections.

### Screenshots

There are a few screenshots captured within the various screen sizes.

## My process

**Here are a few hightlights from my implementation**

I was playing more with the CSS Flexbox and Grid gaps and tried to be more cautions about the best use-case for it. The amount of gaps was recuded and in lots of cases a simple `justify-content: space-between` was applied with appropriate size of the flex container.

The cards and review components with special "stair effect" was relatively straightforward. I was very sure that an appropriate size of flex container combined with the specific self positioning of each flex child could do the trick. And it did and that part was relatively simple in the end.

The rest of the project was just a standard stuff. I applied the CSS Grid for the main structure and CSS Flexbox for the rest.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Mobile-first workflow
- CSS Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- CSS Custom Properties (variables)
- [Parcel](https://parceljs.org) - a simple, zero config builder

### Continued development

It's still fun doing these [Frontend mentor challenges](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges) in my spare time. Last few weeks were quite busy for me as I was travelling/on holidays. But I am back in routine and ready to continue solving and submitting the challenges.
